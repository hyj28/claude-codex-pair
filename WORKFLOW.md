# The /pair Dual-Agent Workflow — Design Doc

> Claude Code plans and reviews, Codex implements, git is automated. Off by default; runs only when explicitly invoked.

## Design principles

1. **Invocation is the switch.** No resident framework, no change to default behavior. The skills run only when you type `/pair` / `/pair-review`; ordinary conversations carry zero overhead.
2. **Context isolation.** The implementer (Codex) and the reviewer (a fresh-context Claude subagent) share no conversation history. The reviewer is read-only and cannot "helpfully" edit code.
3. **Deterministic quality gates.** Format / lint / typecheck / test are judged by script exit codes — never by an agent claiming "tests pass". Exit codes alone only prove nothing already-working broke, so the gate also asserts the test count did not fall below the pre-handoff baseline, that the diff did not weaken the suite, and — when the change has a runtime surface — that the program actually starts and does what the scenarios agreed before the handoff say it should (see below).
4. **Don't constrain the base model.** The handoff document given to Codex states goals, constraints, acceptance criteria, and pointers to relevant files — deliberately not the implementation approach.
5. **Bounded loops.** Fix–gate cycles cap at 2 rounds, review–fix cycles cap at 2 rounds; at the cap the workflow stops and reports instead of spinning forever.
6. **A commit per gated step.** Claude Code commits — never Codex — each time the quality gates go green: one commit for the implementation, one per review round. Gate-fix rounds fold into the following checkpoint, so no commit is ever made while a gate is red. The branch carries a readable trail (what was built → what each review round changed) and is meant to be merged as-is, with no squashing or history rewriting. Committing stays with the orchestrator because that is where the artifact/`.gitignore` check and the gate results live; Codex is told to leave its changes in the working tree.

## The bridge (no manual context copying)

- Claude Code invokes Codex headlessly from within the session:
  `codex exec -s workspace-write -c approval_policy=never - < handoff.md` — the handoff travels via stdin and never pollutes the project directory.
- **The sandbox is pinned on the command line, never inherited.** Headless runs disable
  approvals, so the sandbox is the only remaining boundary; passing `-s` explicitly keeps a
  temporarily laxer `~/.codex/config.toml` (e.g. a global `danger-full-access`) from silently
  widening what `/pair` can do. Review invocations pin `-s read-only`.
- Fix rounds use `codex exec resume --last "<feedback>"` — Codex keeps its full implementation context, so only incremental feedback is sent.
- Codex's output returns to Claude Code through `git diff`; review, quality gates, and the commits are all automated.

## Environment & dependencies

The sandbox boundary turns out to be exactly the right permission boundary, so the policy needs no new enforcement mechanism — only a written rule so the implementer knows where the line is and a denial gets read as "this needs a human" rather than "the tool is flaky":

- **Project-local setup is self-service.** Creating the virtualenv, installing declared dependencies, fetching modules — these write only inside the repo, which is precisely what `workspace-write` allows.
- **Package-manager caches are granted explicitly.** They live outside the repo (`~/.cache/uv`, `~/.npm`, …), so the sandbox denies them by default and installs fail with an opaque error. Each `codex exec` grants the cache roots for the project's ecosystem via `--add-dir` — those directories only, never `$HOME`, never config or credential directories. A writable cache is real attack surface (a poisoned artifact executes on the next install); it is the accepted cost of not re-downloading everything each task.
- **System-level installs stop and ask.** Package managers, global installs, `sudo`, new interpreters or runtimes, container runtimes. The sandbox denies these and approvals are off, so they cannot be escalated — the workflow reports what is needed and the exact command, and resumes after the user has run it. This is not a quality-gate failure and does not consume a fix round.
- **Containers are never driven by the implementer.** Beyond the socket living outside the workspace, `docker run -v /:/host` is a complete sandbox escape; granting an agent container access cancels the sandbox. If the gates need a service, the orchestrator or the user starts it beforehand.

One known tension: dependency installation needs the network, so `sandbox_workspace_write.network_access` stays enabled for implementation. Review invocations, which never install anything, run under `-s read-only`.

## What the gates actually prove

A green test suite is evidence that nothing which used to work is broken. It is not evidence
that the new behavior is tested — a change no test touches leaves the suite green. Worse, the
instruction "make the tests pass" given to an agent with write access to the tests has an
obvious cheap solution: change the tests. And all of it is static: nothing so far has started
the program. So the gate is four checks, not one:

1. **Exit codes** — every applicable gate command returns zero.
2. **Test count** — at or above the baseline recorded *before* the handoff, and non-zero. A
   runner that matches no files still exits 0; without a baseline that reads as success, and a
   pre-existing red suite burns a fix round on debt that was never ours.
3. **Test integrity** — the diff of the project's test paths is read before committing. A
   deleted test, a loosened assertion, a newly mocked-out collaborator, an added `skip`, or an
   expected value recomputed the way the code computes it are all red gates, not style nits.
   New behavior with a flat test count is likewise red.
4. **The program runs.** A build that compiles and a suite that passes still leave "crashes on
   launch" untouched. A fresh subagent — one that has not read the diff, because a driver who
   has read the implementation stops being a user — starts the program and walks the scenarios
   written down in Phase 1, before any code existed. It returns a table of command, verbatim
   output, expected result, match/mismatch; "ran it, works" is refused for the same reason
   "tests pass" is. A mismatch goes back through the fix loop with a test attached, so the
   finding is bought once instead of re-discovered every round.

Not every change has something to run. Gate 4 resolves to one of three outcomes, recorded
either way: drive the real entry point; drive a **substitute surface** (a throwaway consumer
of the named seam, for a library with no entry point); or *not applicable*, permitted only for
a stated reason — no runtime surface at all, a behavior-preserving refactor, a need for
hardware or production credentials, an unautomatable GUI, or side effects that cannot be
confined to scratch data. "The tests cover it" is not one of the reasons, since doubting
exactly that is the gate's job. A not-applicable verdict has to name what covers the change
instead.

The handoff asks for tests at named **seams** — the public boundaries the behavior is observed
through — because testing effort has to land somewhere deliberate, and a seam agreed up front
is the only version of that decision anyone can check later. The strict profile adds one more
step: stash the implementation, confirm the new tests actually fail without it, restore. A test
that has never been red may be asserting nothing.

Checks that cannot be evaluated (a runner that reports no count, a project with no test paths)
are reported as unavailable. An unavailable check must never read as a passing one.

## Usage

| Command | When | Flow |
|---|---|---|
| *(nothing)* | Small edits, questions | Normal chat; the workflow doesn't exist |
| `/pair fast <task>` | Small task, but let Codex do it | One-paragraph instruction → Codex → gates → commit |
| `/pair <task>` | Medium feature (default: standard) | Clarify → handoff doc → branch → Codex → gates → commit → read-only Claude review (≤2 fix rounds, commit per round) |
| `/pair strict <task>` | High-risk / complex change | Standard + human plan approval + dual review (Claude subagent and `codex exec review`); stops to ask on high-severity disagreement |
| `/pair-review` | Just a second pair of eyes | Fresh read-only subagent reviews uncommitted changes; add `codex` to also run Codex's native review, `base <branch>` to review a branch diff |

Merging, pushing, and opening PRs are always your call — the workflow only commits to the feature branch it created (named after the task, no prefix).

## Hard human-decision gates

Regardless of profile, the workflow stops and asks before:

- merging into the main branch, or pushing anywhere
- database migrations
- deleting or overwriting user data
- auth, permissions, or payment logic
- breaking changes to a public API
- large dependency additions/upgrades

## Trade-offs vs. community frameworks

- **Superpowers**: not installed. Four ideas were borrowed — a lightweight brainstorm before planning (at most 2–3 questions, and only when the task is ambiguous), the handoff plan as the inter-agent artifact, verification-before-completion, and capped fix/review loops. Its heavyweight defaults — full ceremony for every micro-task, mandatory TDD, a fresh subagent per task — were not adopted.
- **OpenSpec / Spec Kit**: neither installed. The strict-profile handoff doc already serves as a lightweight spec shared by both agents. Spec Kit can be re-evaluated if a large greenfield project ever calls for it.

## Optional extensions (add when needed)

- **Auto Draft PR**: with `gh` CLI installed and authenticated, Phase 6 can add `gh pr create --draft`.
- **Reverse direction**: add a custom command under `~/.codex/prompts/` so that Codex TUI can call `claude -p` for a review with one command — useful on Codex-first workdays.
- **Parallel tasks**: when running multiple `/pair` tasks at once, switch to `git worktree` so each task gets an isolated directory.
